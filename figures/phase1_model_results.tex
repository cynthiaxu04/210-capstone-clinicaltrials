\caption{Modeling results comparing the Long, et al. model and our model, ClinicalAI. Our recreation of the Long, et al. model gave a baseline k-fold mean accuracy of 0.682 on Phase 1 lymphoma trial data. Our ClinicalAI model was either as good as or outperformed the Long model whether on lymphoma only or general oncology trial data.}
